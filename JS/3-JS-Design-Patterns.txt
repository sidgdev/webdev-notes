Major JS design patterns-

1) Plain Old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors
2) Factory Functions and the Module Pattern
3) Classes
4) ES6 Modules
5) SOLID principles

1) Object constructor-

    function Player (name, marker) {
        this.name = name
        this.marker = marker
        this.sayName = function() {
            console.log(name)
        }
    }
    const player1 = new Player('Steve', 'X')
    player1.sayName()   // Logs 'Steve'

-> In JS, we capitalize the first letter of a constructor function by convention.

    Object.getPrototypeOf(player1) === Player.prototype             // Returns true
    Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype) === Object.prototype    // Returns true

-> getPrototypeOf() returns prototype of object passed
-> By default all objects and constructors inherit from Object.prototype (Prototypal Inheritance)

    Player.prototype.greet = function () {
        return `${this.name} says hello.`;
    }

-> It is a common practice in JS to define methods on the prototype for increased efficiency and code readability
-> Object.keys only returns own keys while for..in loops over both own and inherited keys
-> for..in loops will not show Object.prototype properties as they are not enumerable

    player1.valueOf()                                     // Returns Object { name: "steve", marker: "X", sayName: sayName() }
    Player.hasOwnProperty('valueOf');                     // Returns false as prototype only has sayName() 
    Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty('valueOf');           // Returns true as valueOf() is defined in Object.prototype 
    Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty('hasOwnProperty');    // Returns true also
    Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype)               // Returns null as inheritance chain ends  

-> player1 can access valueOf() as it looks down the prototype chain player1 -> Player -> Object

    Object.setPrototypeOf(Player.prototype, Person.prototype)    // Player inherits from Person

    Player.prototype = Person.prototype     // Player.prototype directly refers to Person.prototype instead of inheriting

-> Using setPrototypeOf() is better as changes in prototype doesn't impact others constructor prototype       
-> isPrototypeOf() can check if an object inherits from certain prototype
-> instanceof operator checks whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere within an object’s prototype chain

    function Hero (name, level) {
    this.name = name;
    this.level = level;
    }

    function Warrior (name, level, weapon) {
        Hero.call(this, name, level);           // Copy constructor properties with call()
        this.weapon = weapon;                   // Add a new property      
    }

-> call() can copy over properties from one constructor into another constructor
-> Prototype properties and methods are not automatically linked when you use call() to chain constructors, use Object.setPropertyOf()
-> Using object constructors without new keyword can lead to harder to resolve errors
-> instanceof can't confirm if object was made with specific constructor since the constructor’s prototype can be reassigned after creation

2.1) Factory Function-

    const personFactory = (name) => {
        const sayHello = () => console.log(`hello ${name}`);
        return { name, sayHello };                              // New object shorthand
    };
    const person = personFactory('jeff');

-> Factory functions are like regular functions that set up and return object, they don't use "new" keyword like object constructors
-> Factory functions can implement private variables and functions through closure 
-> Inheritance can be achieved by using destructuring assignment on a property of inherited object inside another factory function-

    const {sayName} = personFactory(name);

-> To inherit everything, Object.assign() can be used-

    const Nerd = (name) => {
        const prototype = Person(name);
        const doSomethingNerdy = () => console.log('nerd stuff');
        return Object.assign({}, prototype, {doSomethingNerdy});
    }

2.2) Module pattern-

    var myModule = (function() {
        var _privateProperty = 'Hello World';
        var publicProperty = 'I am a public property';

        function _privateMethod() {
            console.log(_privateProperty);
        }

        function publicMethod() {
            _privateMethod();
        }

        return { publicProperty, publicMethod }
        
    })();

    myModule.publicMethod();                    // outputs 'Hello World'
    console.log(myModule.publicProperty);       // outputs 'I am a public property'
    console.log(myModule._privateProperty);     // is undefined protected by the module closure
    myModule._privateMethod();                  // is TypeError protected by the module closure

-> Module pattern is best for hiding variables and functions as private instead of creating multiple objects
-> Module pattern is based on IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) having a factory function inside
-> Module pattern was used for modular code before ES6 modules hence the name
-> As convention, private properties are named with underscore in beginning 

3) Classes-

    class MyClass {
        publicProp = value;         // public property with default value
        #pvtProp;                   // private property
        static prop;                // static property

        constructor (...) { 
            this.prop = arg;
            ...
        }

        publicMethod (...) {}       // public method
        #pvtMethod (...) {}         // private method
        static method ()            // static method

        get something () {          // getter method
            return this.prop;
        }

        set something (...) {       // setter method
            this.prop = arg;
        }
    }

-> classes use get and set keywords for getter and setter functions
-> 'extends' keyword can create a class as a child of another constructor (either class or function)
-> child classes can use 'super' keyword to access properties or invoke constructor of a superclass

4) ES6 Modules-

    // a file called myModule.js
    
	const funcval = 10;
    const functionOne = () => 'ONE';
    const functionTwo = () => 'TWO';

    export default functionOne;		// default export		
	export {funcval, functionTwo};	// named export 

    // index.js file
    
    import funcOne, {functionTwo} from './myModule';	// imports functionOne, functionTwo

-> named imports/exports is special syntax and is not related in any way to declaring object literals or destructuring
-> only single thing can exported in default export and can be renamed while importing
-> Node.js uses CommonJS (CJS) which uses syntax like require and module.exports instead of import and export

5) SOLID principles-

    Single Responsibility Principle - every class should have only one responsibility
    Open-Closed Principle - software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    Liskov Substitution Principle - functions using pointers/references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it
    Interface Segregation Principle - clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use
    Dependency Inversion Principle - depend upon abstractions, not concretes
