State - "Data which controls how program is behaving" or "Data which has an effect on the result and output of program"

useState hook-

-> useState hook is built-in hook that allows you to define state in a functional component 
-> It takes initial value as a parameter and returns an array with two elements that we can destructure to get-
    1) current state value
    2) function to update the state value

    const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialValue);

React Rerendering-

-> when a component's state or props change, React updates virtual DOM and reconcile changes with the actual DOM
-> Rerendering is done with minimal set of changes needed to update actual DOM through reconciliation algorithm
