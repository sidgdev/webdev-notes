Toolchains to setup react-
1) Vite
2) Gatsby
3) NextJS
4) Create React App (deprecated)
5) via CDN in script tag

Setting up react from scratch-

Package Management (NPM, Yarn)
Module bundling (Webpack, Parcel)
Compilation (Babel)
React itself

Creating a new react app with Vite-

    npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

Using existing repo-

    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react

React features-

-> React is declarative in nature 
-> React uses JSX which allows to write HTML-like markup inside JS file
-> React is composable in nature allowing to make components which can be reused, organized & imported as required

React DevTools-

-> checking component props and state (components Tab)
-> checking component rendering performance (Profiler Tab)
-> checking context values passed to components and global state 

React main component overview-

    import { StrictMode } from "react";
    import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
    import App from "./App.jsx";
    import "./index.css";

    createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
        <StrictMode>
            <App />
        </StrictMode>,
    );

Rules of JSX-

1) Return a single root element (fragments can be used)
2) Close all the tags
3) camelCase for most things

JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces-

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX-

1) As text directly inside a JSX tag
2) As attributes immediately following the = sign

-> double curlies can be used to pass inline CSS and objects to JSX

React props-

    <MyComponent varName = "data">

    function MyComponent() {
        return (
            <p> My value is { props.varName } </p>
        )
    }

-> Props are properties passed to components written like attributes inside component calls 
-> Props can only be passed from parent to child components and is read only

Callback props-

-> Callback prop is a function passed as prop to get data from child to parent component

React hooks-

-> Hooks are special react functions for managing component state and other properties
